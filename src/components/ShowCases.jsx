                The exhibition also features a workshop for artists and writers on March 26, where the participants would express and exchange their thoughts on the theme â€˜Nature's fury over Japan'. Organised by the Indo-Russian Cultural & Friendship Society (IRCFS), it is a group of passionate artists who believe that enabling a shared space for artists with different areas of expertise and varied experiences would enrich the art and promote healthy exchange and learning.
